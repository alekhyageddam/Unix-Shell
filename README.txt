•	To compile my shell, do the following: gcc -o pa2 pa2.c

•	To run my shell, use this command: ./pa2

•	After the execution of every ps command that includes the pipe, the control goes back out of my shell window back to the main. This requires calling “./pa2” on shell again to restart my shell.

•	Some of the test commands such as “ps -a | head =5”, grep its < test.txt work. As in, they make the necessary changes to the files even though an error message denoting “illegal argument” may show up on the command prompt.

•	Another thing to note is that the echo prints out the output twice, instead of just once.
